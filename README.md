# OpenBPMD - evaluating ligand pose stability using metadynamics

### Background 
OpenBPMD is an open source implementation of binding pose metadynamics (BPMD). Based on work by [Clark et al, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00201). Primarily built for reranking docked poses out of a list of candidates generated by a docking program. OpenBPMD biases ligands using metadynamics and evaluates how stable they are during the simulation. Recommended to be used in conjunction with [_grand_](https://github.com/essex-lab/grand) to optimise water networks around the ligand before subjecting it to metadynamics.

### Installation & Usage

The dependencies needed for running the scripts can be installed with conda:

```
conda create -n openbpmd
conda activate openbpmd

conda install -c conda-forge -c omnia openmm
conda install -c conda-forge mdanalysis
conda install -c conda-forge mdtraj
conda install -c conda-forge parmed
```

Once the dependencies have been installed, running OpenBPMD involves simply running one of the Python scripts. Have a look at the ```examples/``` directory for further instructions on how to run and analyse the OpenBPMD results.

For <strong>PyFlare</strong> users, MDAnalysis installation is all that's required:
```
pyflare -m pip install --user mdanalysis
```

### DEMO
This blog post demonstrates the powerful capability of the combined use of Flare and OpenBPMD in assessing the stability of protein-ligand binding poses, using two binding poses of tubulin α-1β with Epothilone A (EpoA) - PDB 1TVK (controversial) and PDB 4I50 (an updated model) - as examples.
