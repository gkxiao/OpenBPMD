### Case study: binding poses of tubulin α-1β with Epothilone A
This blog post demonstrates the powerful capability of the combined use of Flare and OpenBPMD in assessing the stability of protein-ligand binding poses, using two binding poses of tubulin α-1β with Epothilone A (EpoA) - PDB 1TVK (controversial) and PDB 4I50 (an updated model) - as examples.
